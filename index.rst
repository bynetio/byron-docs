The main goal of this project is to design and implement a
decentralized exchange app. DEX DApp allows users to
exchange supported tokens with other users. Users can also
invest their supported tokens and emit "liquidity orders" to
provide a liquidity pool, and therefore obtain commission in
the form of exchange fees for doing so.
